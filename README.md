## Description

> Silly Pet Friend is a simple interactive simulator about taking care of a silly pet friend.
> The player can choose to either feed or play with the pet, but the pet’s internal needs are hidden.
> Because the player does not know whether the pet actually wants food or attention, each choice player made might result in the pet feeling happy or run away.
> This outcome is random.

## Interaction Instructions

- Click the Feed or Play button to take care of the pet.
- After each choice, the pet will either have a happy reaction (win screen) or run way (loose screen).
- On the win or lose screen, click anywhere or press R to restart and return to the game.
